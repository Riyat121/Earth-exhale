<h2>Project Description<h2/>
This project is a pixel-perfect replica of a Figma design, built using React.js and Tailwind CSS. The goal of the project was to accurately translate a high-fidelity UI design into a fully responsive, accessible, and interactive web experience.

The application maintains the exact visual hierarchy, spacing, and color system presented in the Figma file. Every component and layout has been implemented with precision to ensure a clean, modern, and professional aesthetic.
